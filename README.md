bigchars creates a PDF file containing one large character on each
page for each character in /string/. The default is to print all ASCII
symbols (33-126) in 500 point Calibri.
The default font is Calibri, for other fonts, scan your system for
.ttf and .otf files and use those, with or without extension.
